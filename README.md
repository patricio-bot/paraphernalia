React e-commerce site (work in progress).

## API

</br>
For this project, I created an API using serverless functions with Airtable and Netlify. It is a very fast, efficient method, ideal for small personal projects that do not require many requests. The limit of allowed requests, in the free plan, to netlify is 150,000.

### Sidenotes

</br>
Since the new version of React does not refresh the browser, I had to revert to the previous version.

"react":"^16.13.1",
"react-dom":"^16.13.1",
